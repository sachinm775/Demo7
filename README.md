To create a lightweight Git tag named "v1.0" for a commit in your local repository, use the following commands:

1. For the most recent commit:
   $ git tag v1.0

2. To tag a specific commit:
   $ git tag v1.0 <commit-SHA>

Replace <commit-SHA> with the actual SHA-1 hash of the commit you want to tag.
